# Greenfield Rails

Greenfield Rails is the base Rails application used at [greenfield](http://greenfieldhq.com). It uses the model from [suspenders](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders) to generate Rails applications.

Installation
------------

NOTE: Until we make a real gem, you can clone the repo and run the `greenfield_rails` binary in `bin/`.

First install the greenfield\_rails gem:

    gem install greenfield_rails

Then run:

    greenfield_rails projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.
